# Password Manager
The Password Manager is a Python project that allows users to generate random passwords, store them securely, and update them using a MySQL database. This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions on how to set it up and use it.

# Features
Generate random passwords with customizable length and complexity.
Store passwords securely in a MySQL database.
Update existing passwords.
Retrieve and display stored passwords.
# Prerequisites
Before running the Password Manager, ensure that you have the following:

Python 3 installed on your system.
The mysql-connector-python library installed. You can install it using pip: pip install mysql-connector-python.
# Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the Password Manager:

Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Install the mysql-connector-python library if you haven't already (see prerequisites).
Create a MySQL database to store the passwords. You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command line.
In the project directory, open the config.py file and update the database connection details (host, user, password, database) to match your MySQL setup.
Run the password_manager.py file using the Python interpreter.
# Usage
Once the Password Manager is set up and running, you can use the following commands:

Generate a new password: Enter 1 to create a new random password. You will be prompted to specify the password length and complexity (e.g., uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters).
Store a password: Enter 2 to save a password to the database. You will be prompted to enter a description for the password and then the password itself.
Update a password: Enter 3 to modify an existing password. You will be prompted to enter the description of the password you want to update and then enter the new password.
Retrieve passwords: Enter 4 to display all stored passwords in the database.
# Security
The Password Manager aims to provide a basic level of security by storing passwords in a MySQL database. However, please note the following considerations:

Ensure that your MySQL database is properly secured with strong access controls.
Protect your database credentials by restricting access and avoiding hardcoding them in the source code.
Consider using additional encryption and security measures to further protect sensitive data.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the Password Manager, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Ensure that you have installed the mysql-connector-python library correctly. Double-check the installation by running pip show mysql-connector-python and verifying that the package is installed.
Verify that your MySQL server is running and accessible. Check the connection details in the config.py file to ensure they are accurate.
Make sure that the user specified in the config.py file has the necessary privileges to access and modify the database. You may need to grant appropriate permissions to the user.
Check your network connection and firewall settings to ensure they are not blocking the connection to the MySQL server.
If you encounter any error messages, search online for solutions or refer to the MySQL Connector/Python documentation for troubleshooting guidance.
# Limitations
The Password Manager project has a few limitations that you should be aware of:

It does not provide advanced encryption or hashing algorithms for storing passwords. Consider additional security measures if you require stronger protection for your sensitive data.
The project currently does not support deleting passwords from the database. You can manually delete records from the database if necessary.
The user interface is command-line based and does not have a graphical interface. It is intended to be a simple demonstration of the functionality.
# Future Enhancements
The Password Manager project can be further improved in several ways:

Implement encryption and hashing algorithms to store passwords securely in the database.
Add support for deleting passwords from the database.
Develop a user-friendly graphical interface using a GUI framework.
Allow users to categorize and organize passwords with tags or folders.
Implement password strength analysis and recommendations.
Integrate multi-factor authentication for accessing the Password Manager.
